## Extra Credit
- Aditional User Role: The "Manager" role is able to create new staff accounts (See the user's guide for instructions on logging in as the manager)
- Order History: The "Fulfill Orders" page shows both currently pending orders and past orders along with what was made, how much was paid, and how much was given in change. This would be sufficient to calculate money made and needed inventory. The order history is displayed as tiles rather than a simple table.
- Privacy Policy: The privacy policy is available in this project's wiki
- Security Audit: The security audit is available in this project's wiki
- Badges: Auto-generating badges that show the last completed iteration and last push to main are at the top of the ReadMe
- UI Enhancements: All previous pages were updated to match a cohesive color scheme and design language
