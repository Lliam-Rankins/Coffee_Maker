# About
This software development project was done in my sophmore year of undergrad, focusing on API calls, SQL data base interaction, and the frontend/backend workflow. This specific project utilized REST API, MySQL, and a signifigant amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal with this website was to provide a coffee ordering service that could manage client orders, shop inventory, as well as recipie control. This required implementation of role based logins, sql interactions to store recepies and updated invenotry, as well as a good user experience.

## Extra Credit
- Aditional User Role: The "Manager" role is able to create new staff accounts (See the user's guide for instructions on logging in as the manager)
- Order History: The "Fulfill Orders" page shows both currently pending orders and past orders along with what was made, how much was paid, and how much was given in change. This would be sufficient to calculate money made and needed inventory. The order history is displayed as tiles rather than a simple table.
- Privacy Policy: The privacy policy is available in this project's wiki
- Security Audit: The security audit is available in this project's wiki
- Badges: Auto-generating badges that show the last completed iteration and last push to main are at the top of the ReadMe
